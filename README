Ghostie is a handy helper for adding "ghost" text to HTML text input fields. It
relies on the Prototype library, so you'll need that too.

Ghostie looks for all <input /> fields of type "text" or "password" (IE not
supported at the moment) with a CSS class of "ghostie". For each input it finds,
it takes the text defined in the "title" attribute and copies it into the
"value" attribute. When the user clicks the field and the value is identical to
the ghostie text, the value is cleared. Likewise, when a submit button in the
same form as the ghostie field is clicked, it clears the values if they haven't
been changed by the user.

The usage is very simple:

  <html>
    <head>
      <script src="prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      <script src="ghostie.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
      <style type="text/css">
        input.ghostie {
          // Styles to be applied to all ghostie fields
        }

        input.ghostied {
          // Styles to be applied to all ghostie fields which haven't been
          // clicked or typed into. You would typically want to set the ghostie
          // font to a lighter colour.
        }
      </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <form>
        <input type="text" class="ghostie" title="Boo!" />
        <input type="submit" class="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    </body>
  </html>
